PhoneGap Essentials
===================

**PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS CODE**. It's here, and you're free to use it if you want, but this book's code was for PhoneGap 2.0 and the project, as well as the book the code is from, has been updated several times since this was published. You can find better and much more complete examples of how to use the Apache Cordova (what became of PhoneGap after it was donated to the Apache Foundation) in my [Apache Cordova API Cookbook](www.cordovacookbook.com). The GitHub repository with all of the code can be found at [https://github.com/johnwargo/apache-cordova-api-cookbook-code](https://github.com/johnwargo/apache-cordova-api-cookbook-code). 
 
This repository contains all of the PhoneGap source code projects highlighted in PhoneGap Essentials - Building Cross-Platform Mobile Apps (www.phonegapessentials.com). 

The application projects included herein were created using PhoneGap 1.0 through PhoneGap 1.9 and therefore still refer to phonegap.js. These projects have been tested on mutiple devices, but not on any version of PhoneGap beyond 1.9. 

The code you see here is intended to augment the material in the book and is intended for people who have purchased a copy of the book. If you use this code and haven't purchased a copy of the book, why not take a moment and buy a copy using the links at http://www.phonegapessentials.com/content/where-buy.html.
